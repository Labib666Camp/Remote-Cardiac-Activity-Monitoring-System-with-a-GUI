# Remote-Cardiac-Activity-Monitoring-System-with-a-GUI

Monitoring cardiac activity is of great importance for diagnosing cardiac irregularities but physicians can't observe a patient throughly due to time and geographical contraints. To solve this, I have created a remote cardiac activity monitoring system using a microcontroller which reads activity data and send it to a server. In the server side, activity is recorded, analysed and inferred on using Deep Neural Network model. A physician can both examine cardiac activity throighout the day or infer from our machine interpretation.
